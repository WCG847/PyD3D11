# PYD3D11 – A Direct3D 11 Package for Python
---

## Introduction

**PyD3D11** is a *Python* package that uses manual reimplementation to create **Direct3D 11** bindings to the language. After witnessing the lack of Windows-oriented control on the GPU-side, we decided to take matters and spearhead an ambitious project that would ensure full utilisation of Windows' capabilities.

## Roadmap

PyD3D11 aims to provide Python developers with direct, low-level access to the full Direct3D 11 API — with parity to its native C/C++ usage. Our goals are to empower users to:

- Issue rendering and compute commands directly to the GPU
- Manage buffers, textures, shaders, and pipeline state objects
- Leverage the full breadth of the Windows graphics stack
- Control swap chains, presentation, and device contexts
- Interact with DXGI for display/output management

## Learn Direct3D 11

We understand that Direct3D 11 can be daunting — both for beginners and experienced developers. To help you make the most of PyD3D11, we've curated learning resources that guide you through the fundamentals and advanced concepts of the API.

## Clone Instructions

As PyD3D11 is a Windows-focused project, all setup examples assume a Windows environment.

To get started, open the **Command Prompt**:

- Press `Win` and search for `cmd`, or  
- Press `Win + R`, then type `cmd` and hit Enter

Navigate to your preferred installation directory:

```bash
cd C:\Your\Preferred\Path
```

Then, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/WCG847/PyD3D11
```
